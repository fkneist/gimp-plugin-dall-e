# GIMP Plugin DALLÂ·E

## Introduction

This is a plugin for the GNU Image Manipulation Program, [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/), making it possible to use [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)'s API [endpoint for image editing](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/images/create-edit). 

## Usage

You provide an image in one layer, a mask with transparency in another layer. Then you execute the plugin and both layers get send to OpenAI's API. The API creates content for the masked pixels and the result is fed back to GIMP as a third layer.

| Layer 1: Input Image | Layer 2: Mask with alpha channel (transparency) | Layer 3: Generated output    |
| --- | --- | --- |

## Installation
* Either take one of the folders found in GIMP: `"Edit" > "Preferences"` then `"Folders" > "Plug-Ins"` or add a folder there
* Copy the folder `gimp-plugin-dall-e` of this repository to that folder
* Make sure `gimp-plugin-dall-e/gimp-plugin-dall-e.py` is executable
* Restart GIMP

## Trying It Out
* Open `./data/sample.xcf` of this project with GIMP
* Click `"Filters" > "Dall-E"`
* Enter your OpenAI API key
* Enter a prompt
* Click generate (note that the plugin uses a paid endpoint, so you will be charged by OpenAI for usage)

## Limitations
* Currently the plugin only works with a resolution of `500 px * 500 px`
* The plugin only works if you provide the source image in layer 1 and the mask with transparency in layer 2
* It takes some seconds for OpenAI to generate the output, so GIMP might assume the plugin crashed, just click "wait"
